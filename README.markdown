JSInputSheet is a great way to gather user input such as login information from within your iOS application.

It's behaviour and usage is based on UIAlertView. Just create an instance of JSInputSheet with a delegate, configure the textfields to your liking and call `show`.

You'll get a call back when the sheet is dismissed, giving you an opportunity to get the text from the fields.
